# Vallentuna Badmintons website

This project is created as my first milestone project at code institute and as an example for a badminton club that I'm builing a similiar website for.
It is my first website and I have learned a lot working on it and feel like I can learn a lot more if I continue with front-end development.

UX

The UX process for this website and for me was that I had several meetings with the management group for the badminton club and they 
really wanted to keep the website as simple as possible. Because the target group for them are people in the same age span as them.
I took their thoughts and ideas in consideration and also to be able to get new members thru the website I added colors and
looked up online and in different books that I borrowed from my friends about psychology with colors to find out what 
colors was appealing to both men and women in all ages.
The website is mainly for handing out information about the badminton club and giving the user an easy way to find the information
he or she needs to come in contact with them or find out where they can come and practice badminton.

I didn't create any mockup or diagrams for this website when I made it, but I took ideas from the original website that the 
badminton club have and went from there.
Original website: http://www.vallentunabadminton.se/

The original website is written in swedish, but the information is about the same on the original and the one I made, with a few changes.

Features
The index page is for the user to find out who we are and to find news about upcoming events quickly.
The "Times and memberships fee" page is for finding information about where and when we practice and how much it cost and how to pay.
the "Contact us" page is a page I came up with for users to ask questions in an easy way to us.
The "Gallery" page is for showcasing different things that have happend, but for this project they are just example pictures.
In the footer on every page you as a user can find contact information the the management team, but for this project they are only examples.

We have discussed a few times about adding in a feature where a user can click in a schedule if they are coming for a specific practice or not.
But I haven't figured out how to do that without implementing a login feature and the badminton club didn't want to handle user information.

Technologies Used
For this project I wrote in HTML for the main structure of the website, CSS for my own styling choices of different elemements and a little bit in javescript for the navigation bar.
For this project I have used Bootstrap for some design elements: https://getbootstrap.com/
I have also used fontawesome for some icons to try and make it more appeling for the user to stay on this website: https://fontawesome.com/start

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
My testing is conducted by the management team for the badminton club. I gave them a copy of the code for the website and they used it as "new users" and old users.
They helped a lot in finding different things that didn't work and helped me see where things could go wrong if a user clicked on something. 

HÄR MÅSTE JAG FYLLA PÅ MED INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Credits
I was inspired by codeintitutes lessons and tryied to make a navbar that looked alot like the one in some of the lessons.
The pictures are taken from https://unsplash.com/s/photos/badminton because I wasn't allowed to use the images from our badminton club.
The design for having all text information in the middle was an inspiration from facebooks design with having all information there and because in the lessons I was told it was a nice way to display text.
The logo on the index page is the real logo for Vallentuna badminton and I have their permission to use it as this is an example for how their website could look, original website: http://www.vallentunabadminton.se/
The text is also from Vallentuna badmintons original site and it is a work in progress as I'm still waiting for them to go over what they want their website to say.
All contact info are just examples because they didn't want their email and phone numbers to be part of my project for codeinstitute.
